# Code Institute - Project One - Rebecca Stevens

## Overview

This is my first project studying software development with Code Institute. I have created a website for a friend who runs a cake business from home. The website consists of four pages (the home, about, portfolio and contact pages). 

## Features

Each page has links to the other pages from the navigation bar. There is a bio page which gives information on the business and the products they make. I have added a short form on the contact page for requesting a callback.(I have a strong preference for short forms). There is also a portfolio for viewing the creations and products of the business. I will be spending further time with the images and product display on the website.

## Tech Used

The website is mainly structured using HTML and CSS. I have added a bit of javascript but I have more work to do there. I have styled the site using bootstrap, mainly for the navigation, and jQuery for implementing javascript. Clicking on the Submit button included in the form triggers an alert message, using javascript, to inform the customer that they will be contacted shortly.
I have made a good attempt to make the website as media responsive as possible, using flexbox mainly, using the mobile first approach.
